If you want to understand how this project works and modify it as your wish, the Wiki could be a good place for you. There, you can find the technical documentation for all the decisions we made, and who knows maybe after that, you'll want to check the issues to solve one or perhaps propose another idea to implement, I'd be happy to make the project our project.
