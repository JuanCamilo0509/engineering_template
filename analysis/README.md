# Analysis folder
This folder contains all the analyses that support and validate the project's design decisions.
The folder is organized into two subfolders:
1. Tests: Where you can find all the tests to satisfy a requirement, including the failed ones. (Each test has its own folder with its name.)
2. Calculation: A space to save everything related to engineering calculations (scripts, math analysis, results, etc.)
